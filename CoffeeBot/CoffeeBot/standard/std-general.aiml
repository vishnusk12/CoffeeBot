Foreclosure is a process that allows a lender to recover the amount owed on a defaulted loan by selling or taking ownership (repossession) of the property securing the loan. The foreclosure process begins when a borrower/owner defaults on loan payments (usually mortgage payments) and the lender files a public default notice, called a Notice of Default or Lis Pendens.

Property owners who are late in their mortgage payments will receive a Notice of Default from their lender.  Notices of default are filed with the local records authority.  A Lis Pendens filing may also be filed to notify any other lien holders. The Notice of Default provides instructions to the homeowner on the amount they are required to pay and how much time they have to pay. If the homeowner pays according to these instructions, the foreclosure process is ended.

<pattern>* AUCTION *</pattern>

If the loan is not reinstated by the end of the pre-foreclosure period, the property will be sold at a public auction. Buyers often are required to pay in cash at the auction and may not have much time to research the title and condition of the property beforehand; however, a public auction often offers the lender a way to quickly liquidate the property.  The lender typically sets a minimum bid at foreclosure auction equal to the amount owed on the property plus fees and various costs to the lender.
